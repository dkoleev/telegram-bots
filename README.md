# telegram-bots

To create a Telegram bot for the game *Rust*, you'll need to use the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and create a bot using a programming language like Python, which has good support for interacting with Telegram via libraries like `python-telegram-bot`. You can also integrate the bot with the *Rust* server to fetch data, manage users, or issue commands.

Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to help you create a basic bot:

### 1. Set up the Telegram bot

1. Go to Telegram and search for "BotFather" (the official Telegram bot for managing bots).
2. Start a chat with BotFather and send `/start`.
3. To create a new bot, send `/newbot` and follow the prompts.
4. Once the bot is created, you’ll get a **Token** that you'll need for authentication.

### 2. Set up your Python environment

If you don’t have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). You’ll also need the `python-telegram-bot` library:

```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot
```

### 3. Write the basic bot code

Here’s a simple bot that responds to the `/start` command:

```python
from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import ApplicationBuilder, CommandHandler, ContextTypes

# Function that will be called when the /start command is used
async def start(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE) -> None:
    await update.message.reply_text("Hello! I am your Rust bot. What do you want to do?")

# Main function to run the bot
if __name__ == '__main__':
    application = ApplicationBuilder().token("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE").build()

    # Add command handler
    application.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))

    # Start the bot
    application.run_polling()
```

### 4. Integrate with Rust

*Rust* server has RCON (Remote Console) support, which allows external programs to interact with the server. To interact with a *Rust* server, you can use the RCON protocol via the `mcrcon` library for Python.

Install it with:

```bash
pip install mcrcon
```

Here’s an example of how to send commands to a *Rust* server using RCON:

```python
from mcrcon import MCRcon

# Connect to the Rust server via RCON
def send_rcon_command(command: str):
    with MCRcon("YOUR_SERVER_IP", "YOUR_RCON_PASSWORD") as mcr:
        response = mcr.command(command)
        return response

# Example command function for checking player status
async def player_status(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE) -> None:
    response = send_rcon_command("status")
    await update.message.reply_text(f"Server status:\n{response}")

# Add this new command handler to the bot
application.add_handler(CommandHandler("status", player_status))
```

### 5. Extend functionality

You can add more commands like:
- `/ban playername` – To ban a player from the server.
- `/unban playername` – To unban a player.
- `/broadcast message` – To broadcast a message to all players.

For each command, you would send the corresponding RCON command through your `send_rcon_command` function.

### 6. Run the bot

To run the bot, simply execute your Python script:

```bash
python telegram_bot.py
```

### Optional: Deploy the bot on a server
If you want your bot to be online 24/7, you can deploy it to a server (like AWS, DigitalOcean, or a VPS).

This is just a basic implementation. You can extend it by adding features like player statistics, automatic reminders, or game-related functionalities. Would you like help with adding specific features?
